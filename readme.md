# 15Char: Social Media Microblog (Twitter-Like)

This project is a simple social media microblog application built with Flask. It allows users to register, log in, create posts, reply to posts, like posts, follow other users, and view a feed of posts from people they follow.

## Contributing
This project was developed for a university project. While not actively seeking contributions, feel free to fork the repository and adapt it to your needs.

## Features
* User authentication (registration, login, logout)
* Create, view, and delete posts
* Reply to posts
* Like/unlike posts
* Follow/unfollow users
* View user-specific posts
* Search for posts
* Change user emoji
* Generate test data (admin access)
* Wipe all data (admin access)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```Bash

python3 -m venv venv
```
### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On macOS/Linux:

```Bash

source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows:

```Bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 4. Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary Python packages using pip:

```Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 5. Database Setup
This project uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions. You need to create and migrate the database.

Create the database:

```Bash

python db_create.py
```
Run migrations (if any):
If you have existing migrations, you'll need to apply them. Given the `migrations` folder, this is likely necessary.

```Bash

# You might need to initialize migrations first if this is a fresh setup
# flask db init (if using Flask-Migrate directly, but db_create.py likely handles this)

flask db upgrade
```
Note: The `db_create.p`y script usually handles the initial database creation and might also run initial migrations. If you encounter issues, refer to the Flask-Migrate documentation or inspect `db_create.py`.

### 6. Run the Application
Once the database is set up, you can run the Flask application:

```Bash

python run.py
```
The application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or another port if configured).

## Usage
1. Register: Navigate to /register to create a new account.
2. Login: Log in with your registered credentials at `/login`.
3. Home Page: After logging in, you'll be redirected to the home page (`/`) where you can see posts and create your own.
4. Explore Features:
    - Click on a username to view their posts.
    - Click on a post to view its replies and interact with it.
    - Use the search bar to find posts.
    - Go to `/profile` to see your own posts.
    - Change your emoji at `/change_emoji`.
    - View who you are following and their posts at `/following`.
### Admin Endpoints (Use with Caution)
Two endpoints are available for administrative tasks. These should not be exposed publicly in a production environment without stronger authentication and authorization.

- Generate Test Data:
URL: `/generate_test_data`
  - Authentication: Basic Auth with username `admin` and password `hamzasiddique`.
  - This endpoint populates the database with fake users, posts, and replies.
- Wipe All Data:
  - URL: `/wipe`
  - WARNING: This endpoint will delete ALL data (users, posts, replies, likes, follows) from your database. Use with extreme caution, primarily for development or testing purposes.

## Project Structure
